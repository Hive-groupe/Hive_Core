  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^1.0.4

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # generate: true

  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' and Android 'package' identifiers should not ordinarily
  # be modified. They are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.
  plugin:
    platforms:
      # This plugin project was generated without specifying any
      # platforms with the `--platform` argument. If you see the `fake_platform` map below, remove it and
      # then add platforms following the instruction here:
      # https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms
      # -------------------
      some_platform:
        pluginClass: somePluginClass
    # -------------------
    # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
    # assets:
    #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
    #
    # For details regarding assets in packages, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    #
    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
    # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
    #
    # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
    # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
